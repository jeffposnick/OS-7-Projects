About Water Pollution		Water pollution is just like any other type of pollution; it occurs when there is a great concentration of a certain substance in a relatively small area. When people hear the term “Water Pollution,” they usually think of large ships dumping barrels of waste into our oceans. While this is one way that water is polluted, pollution  also comes from the home.     Soaps, bleaches, dyes, and other every-day materials go down the drain along with our water, whether we realize it or not. The question is, where do these pollutants go after they have gone down the drain? They do not just disappear.	After it goes down the drain, the waste water is pumped through our sewer systems to water treatment plants. Workers in these plants try to remove the waste we put into our water by using both physical and chemical means.	There are a number of ways to physically purify water (remove any particles of sewage),   but the most common methods are filtration or screening. Filtration is when water is filtered through sand or gravel. Screening, as the name implies, is when screens are placed in flowing water, which will remove any debris. 	Chemical purification involves adding chemicals to the water that kill harmful bacteria. One of the most common chemicals used in this process is chlorine.	If any of this polluted water was untreated though, serious side effects could occur in nature. Nearby plants and animals, along with any humans, who rely on the water to live risk bringing in poisonous substances into their systems. One place where a scenario like this might occur is in India or some other poor country with a large population, because it simply isn’t possible to treat all the water.
